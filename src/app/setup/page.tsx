              Titanium Network's services can be utilized either by hosting them
              manually or using the officially hosted services. These servies
              such as Holy Unblocker or Incognito can be obtained in the{" "}
              <a href="discord.gg/unblock">TN Discord</a> with a brief overview
              on the <a href="/services">Services</a>.

            <h3>Web Proxy Services</h3>
            <p>
              In order to use a web proxy site, you would simply obtain any of
              our official domains (URLS/mirrors) from the Titanium Network
              discord.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Example Mirror/URL: <code>https://holyubofficial.net</code>
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Then you would just simply access the mirror URL on any modern
              browser, enter in a site within the search engine on the proxy
              site and enjoy unblocked content!
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Kajigs</h3>
            <p>
              A repository of methods/exploits (found in the TN Discord)
              maintained by Titanium Network that you can employ, enabling you to
              bypass restrictions!
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              These exploits range from WebView bypasses, extension bypasses,
              chromeOS vulnerabilities, Windows elevation bypasses, and most web
              filter bypasses.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              The most specialized part of Titanium Network would lastly be the
              development of Bookmarklets which can be used to exploit either
              extension bypasses to simply history flooding tools.
            </p>
